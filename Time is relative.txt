Albert Einstein once stated that , Time is relative meaning that the passage of time is not absolute rather it depends on the frame of reference of the observer's motion and the gravitational field.

That is , faster speed results in a slower time . For instance , a clock in a spaceship moving at the speed of light ticks slower than one on earth at rest. This is the scientific meaning of the phrase "Time is Relative".

But here I am going to talk about the psychological reference to Time relativity .Although they are not scientifically connected , we can still relate them . Because , our individual perception of time is completely subjective. Time passes quickly when we are doing something new and engaging to us .In contrast , boredom and  repetitiveness can drag it .

Just like in physics where time depends on our frame of reference , in time management we can change our frame of reference to match our priorities and mold our mindset. Time relativity teaches us that time is flexible.
We can change it to our needs. Or in other words we can bend it by focus , planning and being productive.
All we have to do is just change our mindset . Newton's theory of relativity showed us that the experience of time can be relative from person to person depending on their goals and focus.

For instance , a physics lecture might feel long and boring when its too difficult to follow. But try to find why the underlying  barrier that cause it in the first place. Is it the complex syllabus ? Or perhaps the your interest is dying? or maybe both?  .
